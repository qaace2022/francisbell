   Ans: 
           Int I=1;
              while(i<6)
      {
             system.out.println(“I will get printed once for sure”);
           
           I++;
}

Questions

1.When to go for double? And when to use float?

 Ans: Double datatype is used for accuracy.
         It stores the decimal number upto 15 numbers after the decimal.

         Float is used to store floating points like 19.99 to -19.99.
         It stores the decimal number upto 7 numbers.

2.Can char store negative numbers in JAVA?

Ans: Char is unsigned datatype so in Java char not store any negative value.

3.Find the output
                            int a=10;
                            Int b=10;
                             System.out.println (a++ + ++a);
 Ans:22

4.Find the output
                           Int b=10;
                           System.out.println(~b);

Ans: 9
It is unary operator and it gives positive of total negative

5.Explore about short circuiting

Ans: If evaluation of a logical expression exits in between before complete evaluation, then it is known as Short-circuit.
A short circuit happens because the result is clear even before the complete evaluation of the expression, and the result is returned
